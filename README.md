# Crypto-API-Client-Wrapper-with-Backtester

Backtest framework for crypto market with Python 3.7

The datafeed the obtained from a custom API client wrapper from CoinGecko API endpoints.
The backtester is written using Object-oriented programming (OOP) method.

OOP is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

Objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python in the overall structure of the program (the data and procedural programming)

The key takeaway from this project is that we created a framework to get data from any rest API endpoints (with a few twists in the code depending on authentication method).
